    <string name="khalas_title">Khalas</string>
    <string name="khalas_desc">Khalas is a variety of date palm fruit, famous in the regions of Al-Qassim, Al-Kharj, and Al-Ahsa in Saudi Arabia. It is distinguished by its ability to retain its excellent flavor even after long periods of storage. It has an apricot-yellow color, a sweet taste, and is typically served with Arabic coffee during social occasions.\n\nIt is considered one of the finest varieties of dates, accounting for approximately 15% to 20% of the palm trees in Al-Ahsa. As a premium commercial variety, it is highly sought after in markets due to its superior quality and long-lasting flavor profile.</string>

    <string name="shishi_title">Shishi</string>
    <string name="shishi_desc">Physical Characteristics:\nColor: Primarily brown with a distinct golden-yellow base.\nSize &amp; Texture: Known for its large size and a thick, slightly dry texture.\nMoisture Content: Contains a moisture level of approximately 17.46%.\n\nTaste &amp; Market Significance:\nFlavor Profile: It is classified as an intensely sweet variety of date.\nEconomic Importance:\nAlong with the \"Khalas\" and \"Razzez\" varieties, it accounts for 75% of the total production in Al-Ahsa.\nThe Shishi date alone constitutes 50% of Saudi Arabia\'s overall date production.</string>

    <string name="razzez_title">Razzez</string>
    <string name="razzez_desc">Historical Status &amp; Production:\nOrigin: Famous in the Al-Ahsa Governorate of the Eastern Province; it was historically the most prominent date variety in the region.\nCurrent Rarity: It is now considered a rare variety because most farmers have prioritized the cultivation of \"Khalas\" dates.\nEconomic Value: Along with Khalas and Shishi, it accounts for 75% of Al-Ahsa\'s total production. The average price per \"Mann\" (a traditional unit of weight) is approximately 700 SAR.\n\nCharacteristics &amp; Uses:\nSize &amp; Appearance: A medium-sized date with a visible outer skin.</string>
